# ESP32_examples 
Examples prepared for workshop content. The examples are built for ESP32-WROOM-32E Dev Kit and Arduino IDE. For setup of Arduino IDE for ESP32, visit [Espressif Arduino Repository](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master) and [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/getting_started.html).

## Content
1. Basic LED
    - Push button once to toggle between on and off LED
3. LDR LED
    - When in dark environment, turn on LED, else off LED
4. Receiver LED
    - Receiver via Bluetooth Classic. When receiving '1', turn on LED. When receiving '0', turn off LED
5. Transmitter Button
    - Transmitter via Bluetooth Classic. When button press, send a signal to toggle LED on receiver
6. Transmitter LDR
    - Transmitter via Bluetooth Classic. When in dark environment, turn on LED, else off LED
